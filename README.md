# KMBF2

Another bugfix mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, but maintained by Kab, author of KMBF (Kingmaker Bugfixes). 

## Fixes and Changes

### Notes

[Opt-in] fixes need to be enabled in the mod's Mod Menu.

[New Save] only works on a new save. Instructions should be provided on how to apply it on an existing save.

### Fixes

- Sword of Valor Aggro
    - Prevents the Sword of Valor aura in the end of act 2 event from aggroing enemies immediately
- Point-blank Master Requirements
    - Removes the Figher level requirements from Point-blank Master, still requires Weapon Specialization
    - This allows classes like Crusader or Shaman to pick PBM while getting Weapon Specialization from their class (without Fighter levels)
- Triceratops Rider Protection
    - Triceratops now correctly give +2 AC to their rider as described
- [New Save] Mythic Lich Skeletal Champions now have Cold immunity, like all other skeletons. Does not work on existing saves, add ColdImmunity through Toybox

### Quality of Life

- [Opt-in] Remove warning icons for non-stacking bonuses on buffs and equipment
